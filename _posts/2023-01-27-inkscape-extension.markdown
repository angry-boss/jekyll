To manually install a new extension, download and unpack the archive file. Copy the files into the directory listed at Preferences > System > User extensions: $USER/Library/Application\ Support/org.inkscape.Inkscape/config/inkscape/extensions. After a restart of Inkscape, the new extension will be available.
